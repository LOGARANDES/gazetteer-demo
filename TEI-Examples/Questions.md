## Things to Think About

### Structuring Data
Possible options
- Create a TEI document for each primary source
- Create TEI documents for each geographic location: city/province, corregimiento, repartimiento, and reduccion
  - Use Syriaca TEI documents as a model
    - Create URI for named people and places?
- Create TEI document for each city/province and include all entities within that hierarchy

### Data To Be Captured
Based on tasa published in *Gobernantes del Peru: Cartas y Papeles, Siglo XVI. Documentos del Archivo de Indias*, vol. 9:
- Bureaucratic structure of city/province
  - Named officials and offices
  - Salaries
- Tribute amounts by city/province and corregimiento
- Overseer of each repartimeinto
- Census numbers by repartimiento or reduccion
- City/ Province
- Repartimiento
- Corregimiento
- Reduccion

How similar or different are the tasas? How is the data presented in each tasa?  What is the date coverage of the tasas? This may dictate how we structure the overall data.

### Presentation of Data
- Maintain archaic spelling and punctuation?
- Present snippets of text with relevant data?
