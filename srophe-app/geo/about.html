                    <i>LOGAR</i> is a geographical index and map of places relevant to Andean studies. It
                    focuses initially on the towns established during the mass colonial resettlement
                    program known as the <i>Reducción General de Indios</i> (General Resettlement of
                    Indians) of the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo. The Reducción forcibly resettled
                    approximately 1.4 million native Andeans into over 800 reducción (literally,
                    “reduction”) towns. Reducciones were founded (at least nominally) during the
                    <i>Visita General</i> (Toledo’s tour of inspection and resettlement) between 1570 and
                    1575. The scope of <i>LOGAR</i> is initially limited to the area under most direct
                    jurisdictional control of Viceroy Toledo—specifically, the audiencias of Lima
                    and Charcas. Following its introduction, <i>LOGAR</i> will be continuously updated by
                    edited contributions by scholars of Andean history in various countries, who
                    have expressed interest in having a tool and repository such as <i>LOGAR</i>. </p>
                <p> As a reference work, <i>LOGAR</i> is organized by an alphabetical index of places and a
                    map of place locations. Users may browse both located and unlocated places. The
                    concept of <i>place</i> is thus central to its organization.
                    Following the conventions of the Pleiades Gazetteer of the ancient Mediterranean world, 
                    <i>LOGAR</i> defines places as “geographical and historical 
                    contexts for names and locations” [1, 2]. [<a href="#note1">1</a>, <a href="#note2">2</a>].
                    Places may refer to discrete, locatable features in the physical world, such as
                    a town or road. But they are not only such features. Places can be jurisdictional entities 
                    without discrete spatial footprints, or any geographical, spatial, or historical context 
                    with a spatial dimension. 
                    This place concept is attributed most proximately to the geographer Yi Fu Tuan  [<a href="#note3">3</a>]. </p>
                <p> Thus, places are not (or at least not only) locations or bounded territorial extents; 
                    places may in fact be un-locatable. Very few maps survive from the sixteenth-century 
                    Andes, and places were almost never precisely located in colonial archival textual 
                    sources. Places were instead most often located by names (toponyms), of varying 
                    historical durability. In cases in which a place is not yet or cannot be located in 
                    <i>LOGAR</i>, its entry is listed in the alphabetic listing of places, with no corresponding 
                    location on the map. Each place entry cross-references instances of its mention in 
                    textual sources. As a practical matter, this concept enables inclusion of places that
                    are not (at least currently) locatable, or preferably not represented as discrete 
                    points or features on a map. Therefore, many places catalogued in <i>LOGAR</i> are not
                    currently located, but they may be in the future, as knowledge expands and as scholars 
                    contribute to LOGAR.
                </p>
                <p>Other place names in archival texts do not refer to spatially bounded entities but, instead, to 
                    ethno-spatial divisions and groups that came to constitute colonial administrative 
                    jurisdictions. For instance, a <i>repartimiento</i> most often referred to an ethnically identified
                    population granted in <i>encomienda</i> (a trusteeship of indigenous labor) to a Spanish 
                    <i>encomendero</i> (trustee). A repartimiento could comprise the population of a single reducción 
                    town, several reducción towns, or parts of several reducción towns; in such cases, families
                    within the same reducción belonged to different repartimientos. <i>LOGAR</i> takes the editorial 
                    position that such instances should be located approximately (and indicating as such) when 
                    possible, with iterative locational revisions as new information is contributed by the <i>LOGAR</i>
                    community.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <i>LOGAR</i> builds directly on the open source code base and architecture of the
                    <a href="http://syriaca.org/">Syriac Gazetteer</a>, using eXistdB (an open source native XML database). 
                    <i>LOGAR</i> is extensible (spatially and temporally), and over the long term, 
                    aims to grow into a general place-based index and serve as a research tool of broad 
                    utility to the scholarly community of the Andean region.
