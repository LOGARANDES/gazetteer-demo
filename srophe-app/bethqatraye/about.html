                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> Beth Qaṭraye, Syriac for “region of the Qataris”, is a term found in Syriac
                    literature referring to the region of North-East Arabia including Qatar and
                    Bahrain from the fourth to the ninth centuries. Beth Qaṭraye was an important
                    cultural, linguistic and religious crossroads in the pre-Islamic and early
                    Islamic period, when it produced one of the most widely translated Syriac
                    authors of all time (Isaac of Nineveh, called after his bishopric, who is also
                    known as Isaac Qaṭraya or “the Qatari”). A number of other important Syriac
                    authors also came from Beth Qaṭraye in this period, and scholarship has so far
                    only focused on these Syriac authors and their writings rather than other
                    aspects of Beth Qaṭraye. The team of this project has just published two ground
                    breaking books on these Syriac authors from Beth Qaṭraye (see Publications).
                    Such a historical reality reveals the important fact that the Syriac community
                    there was not only surviving but producing the finest and most educated authors
                    of the time many of whom became intellectual, spiritual or religious leaders in
                    the Middle East as a whole. The objective of this research project is to collect
                    and analyze information on the pre-Islamic and early Islamic historical
                    geography and toponyms of the Beth Qaṭraye region from the most important
                    available sources as well as later toponymical studies. The toponyms will shed
                    light on the language of Beth Qaṭraye in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic
                    period by analyzing their Syriac, Aramaic and Arabic etymology and name
                    components. The historical and archaeological geography will clarify the
                    cultural relations between this region and other areas around the Gulf, and how
                    patterns of social predominance shifted over time. This will provide a better
                    understanding of not only the dynamics of society within Beth Qaṭraye, but also
                    the place of Beth Qaṭraye within the larger history of the Middle East in the
                    pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods. The second objective of this project is
                    to determine the set of lexemes that are designated in the Syriac/Arabic lexicon
                    of Bar Bahlul and other Syriac texts such as the Synodicon Orientale and the
                    East-Syriac Anonymous Commentary as belonging to the dialect of Beth Qaṭraye.
                    This will shed important light on the languages and dialects that were in use in
                    the Arabian Peninsula not only in the pre-Islamic period, but also what has
                    survived there in the post-Islamic period since Ibn Bahlul, for example, belongs
                    to the tenth century. The project will produce a number of publications
                    including a toponymical and a lexical dictionary in addition to an online
                    lexical search tool and a project website. </p>
