        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            <em>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</em> is a multi-volume reference publication designed to serve as a name and biographic  authority record documenting persons relevant to the field of Syriac studies. While the <em>SBD</em> is not itself a prosopography in the tradition sense, in combination with its sibling publication <em>SPEAR: Syriac Persons Events and Relations</em> it forms the core of Syriaca.org's prospographical database.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>The aim of the <em>SBD</em> is to provide a minimal unique identification for every person entry. All entries must include at least one specific primary or secondary source citation and most entries also contain name variant information. When possible some entries contain greater biographical detail although such detail is not the primary goal of the publication. The primary purpose is to provide a unique identifier (a <a href="http://syriaca.org/exist/apps/srophe/documentation/terms.html#uri">URI</a>, uniform resource identifier) for each Syriac person to facilitate cataloguing and linked data both within Syriaca.org and externally with Syriaca.org's digital collaborators.</p>
        <p>Because the primary purpose of the <em>SBD</em> is to aid digital cataloguing and linking the sole criteria for inclusion of entries is relevance to Syriac studies. "Relevant persons" include all persons who spoke, wrote or otherwise used Syriac language, but also a broader range of persons including those named in Syriac texts, persons of interest to historians who work on Syriac texts, persons producing scholarship on Syriac, and persons connected in anyway to Syriac cultures.  There are no temporal or spatial boundaries for the database, which collects data on persons from any period past or present useful for Syriac studies, from persons mentioned in Syriac biblical texts to members of the contemporary diaspora communities. Similarly, historicity is not a selection criteria. The <em>SBD</em> includes entries on mythical, fictional and hagiographic persons when they are of significance for research on Syriac culture. Moreover, anonymous persons and groups can also be included in the <em>SBD</em> when sufficient citation information is available to uniquely distinguish each group. Each entry is a conceptual person with a mental existence related to, but not reducible to, its historical manifestation.  Persons in the database can be annotated with relationships to other persons, and they will link with other Syriaca.org resources, such as <em>The Syriac Gazetteer</em>.</p>
